I’ve recently discovered the ZettelKasten Method for researching and taking notes.

I first heard about it when I signed up for Roam Research a note taking tool for networked thought who’s popularity1 is skyrocketing.

I got in right before the servers crashed and they had to make Roam and invite only beta. It was free then2 and I just didn’t get it. People talked about the Zettelkasten Method or Second Brain method by Tiago Forte, but I’d never heard of either of them, and when I research both, the one that stuck with me was the Zettelkasten Method.

There have been offshoots of Roam, some free, some paid, and it’s not hard to understand why. The buzz around Roam is real.

I’ve looked at several different free alternatives to Roam even though I am a paying customer and in either a Reddit or newsletter post I found Foam.

According to the docs:

My current portfolio is written in Jekyll with a premade theme I found on GitHub. I have had many different versions over the years1, most of which I have found some boilerplate online and customized it2.

Below are some screenshots of my current portfolio.


    
     
       Landing page  
       
          
            
            
        
       
    



    
    
       Projects page 
       
          
            
            
        
       
    



    
    
       A &quot;skills&quot; page and timeline.      
       
          
            
            
        
       
    



    
    
      CSS transforms for whimsy
       
          
            
            
        
       
    


It’s nice enough, but I didn’t design or build this. I just edited a template and there it was. Finished portfolio. That’s it. Right?

Time to grow up

Losing my job was the best thing to happen to me as a dev for a variety of reasons. Having the job in the first place and flailing was also one of the best things to happen to me. I learned so much by struggling daily with the tasks I needed to do. Once laid off and stepping back a bit, I took the opportunity to learn and build stuff and get better as a developer. I did some hard things, some fun things, and took up some courses to learn algorithms and system design.

I’ve leveled up even more so than just a couple months ago. I have confidence. So I feel like it is beyond time to expand my skills and rebuild my entire portfolio from scratch.

Portfolio Inspo

I don’t know how I came upon Brittany Chiang’s portfolio but I am glad I did. I am struck by the animations, the design, the aesthetic. It is right up my alley. The problem is I am not skilled enough at design to pull this off.


    
    
      Brittany&#39;s portfolio is first class
       
          
            
            
        
       
    


So instead of just straight up forking this and editing it, I downloaded the zip to my machine and went through the code, looking at the package file to see what was installed. It’s a Gatsby site, which I am familiar with, so I looked at the config, the webpack config, and more. I even asked a question about a webpack config I didn’t understand in the repo and when answered, went looking deeper for documentation on the limitations of webpack server-side rendering.

I am not ripping this off. I will do my own design and make it nice, going just slightly above my comfort level.

Gatsby is my choice for portfolio self-expression

Gatbsy boilerplate is easy to get running and configurable. Then it is up to you to make it your own. I am using the gatsby-starter-default Starter and going from there.

Ali Spittel explained it best on the We Learn Code blog:


  Make a portfolio that is a true expression of yourself. Programming is in a lot of ways a creative field, so use your creativity!


[…]


  I would steer away from using a template found online – to me, it’s pretty apparent when these are used. I understand using them for people who aren’t web developers, but if you are a web developer show off your skills!


That’s good enough reason for me to grow up and get my hands dirty.

*A case study on a trial by fire primer on CSS.

Well, this was a ride. But I came out on the other end. The following is a case study of my journey adding low highlights to headings and links to this blog.


To add a bit more color and style to this blog by adding a low highlight to headers and links, much like you can find on the Rust landing page and Wes Bos’ website.


    
    
       Rust&#39;s landing page highlights
       
          
            
            
        
       
    



    
    
       Wes&#39; sense of design is always top notch. Always a bit of whimsy with his stuff.
       
          
            
            
        
       
    



    
    
       Wes kinda trolling me lol.
       
          
            
            
        
       
    


Motivation

I wanted my blog to look cool and modern, fancy, like the big kids in this space. I also wanted to flex my CSS muscles, as that is one of my weaker areas1.

Process
At first, I went into DevTools and copied the CSS from Rust’s webpage. It didn’t quite work. None of my highlights were showing and I didn’t debug because I felt like something deeper was at play2. I decided to skip this idea and go a different route.

I did a bit of Google-fu on how to get this effect and came across  How to create a low highlight behind your text by Thirty Eight Visuals. It’s a tutorial on how to do this on Squarespace but you can apply it to any website.

I copied this snippet of code:

 background: linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0) 65%, #ffc1d2 65%);
  display: inline;


created a class and added that to the h1 element in my page.html file. The resulting code looks something like this:

h1.highlight {
  background: linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0) 65%, #ffc1d2 65%);
  display: inline;
}


This worked for all the h1 elements, but I also wanted the h2 and h3 elements to be highlighted. In this instance, it also only highlighted the h1 elements on the index page, which in my Jekyll theme is default.html.

I tried to add a class to all the header elements but it still didn’t work. I found it difficult to actually target those specific elements with the .highlight class. If I added the class to all the header elements in one template, it didn’t go across all the other templates in my _layouts folder.

Targeting inline header elements

I wanted all header elements to be highlighted on every page. It was difficult to accomplish this with the different templates that my Jekyll theme has in its _layouts folder.

I dug into the Sass in my theme and looked for any classes that targeted what I wanted and added the gradient to them but that also didn’t work.


    
    
       This image doesn&#39;t capture the half of it...
       
          
            
            
        
       
    


I decided to head back to Google, Stack Overflow and try to find something to help me with this.

MDN and the :not() selector

One of the things I wanted to do was exclude certain elements with certain classes. I found the  :not() selector on MDN.

At first it confused me; what are we excluding?

At first I selected all of the elements I wanted to change and added the :not() selector, for instance p:not(.some-class) which highlighted all the p elements that did not have that class. This meant all paragraphs in the body were selected.

I tried to add the linear gradient to all the main hn selectors which meant even those elements that I didn’t want selected, like the tags or header in the newsletter box had the gradient added to them which I didn’t want. I also wanted to add the gradient to different links in the body. I did the same for the anchor elements, not realizing that the social icons and tags were also links, thus having all the social icons, tags, and other buttons included in the linear gradient selection. It was a disaster so I went back to the docs and reread them.

Decided :not() was not the right selector3

I tried to use :first-child() selector but then I’d need to select different elements that were not descendants to the parent element because this Jekyll theme and Liquid templating is hard to reason about when it comes to custom styles.

Looked up the :nth-child() selector and decided that wouldn’t work either.

Sat on it for a few minutes, Googling and trawling Stack Overflow.

Back to basics

Went back to CSS fundamentals and realized I could just add a background: #fff to the elements that I didn’t want the highlight to be included in. Learned more about specificity and how to order selectors along the cascade to target specific elements, for example:

p.site-info a {
  background: #fff;
}

to target all the p elements with the class site.info that have an anchor tag, a as a descendant I also changed the color of the text selection when a user selects text on most of the site with the ::selection selector.

Oh …and a scrollbar

What good is a dev blog without a fancy scrollbar?

Got the idea from swyx and CSS-Tricks.

body::-webkit-scrollbar {
  width: 1em;
}

body::-webkit-scrollbar-track {
  -webkit-box-shadow: inset 0 0 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}

body::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
  background: rgb(6, 215, 217);
  background: linear-gradient(45deg, rgba(6, 215, 217, 1) 0%, rgba(255, 193, 210, 1.00) 35%, rgba(6, 215, 217, 1) 100%);
  border-radius: 3em;
}


scrollbar CSS-Tricks


  See the Pen 
  Scrollbar Idea (CSS-Tricks) by Tiffany White (@tiffanywhitedev)
  on CodePen.




Conclusion

CSS can be fun at times and sprucing up this blog with some fancy CSS tricks was quite an adventure.

Learning about specificity, different CSS selectors, and the like, made for a fun yet frustrating evening and I am glad I did it.

Edit:

I could have used a CSS variable instead of writing background: #fff everywhere, declaring the :root pseudo-class and declaring a variable like so:

:root {
  --non-highlights: #fff;
}


And then applying this variable everywhere I need, like this:

.non-highlights {
  var(--non-highlights)
}


I plan on implementing this soon.

I am going to be doing some blogging about my projects and what I am learning along the way. I said back in 2018 that I was switching things up, but as someone searching for a job, I feel like all types of content should go here.


I have been brushing up on my CSS lately1 and what I’ve discovered is that CodePen is the perfect place to prototype different concepts.

It’s quick and dirty, no real complicated setup needed. Just jump in, create a div with some class and start firing some CSS in the CSS section. It live updates so you can see your changes almost immediately.

*Learning the hard way that CSS, is in fact, a necessary skill.

Most of experience with CSS was through libraries like Bootstrap, Reactstrap, Bulma, and Tailwind.css.

In this recent project, I had to Flexbox and Flexbox quickly. I have a Wes Bos grid and flexbox course sitting in the course library I have of his. I never watched either, thinking I was mainly going to JavaScript the f out of things with little consideration to the styling.

I like beautiful things but CSS intimidates me, as it does a lot of JavaScript devs. You know the gif I’m talking about. I just recently shared this gif on a site complaining about how hard CSS is.

I have a metric heckton of respect for CSS mavens and masters. Because I suck at it. Give me the logic in a project and I’ll get it done. Tell me to skew a div and I am like what are a skew? What means degrees? I am terrible at complex layouts like this.

CS web dev classes

I took an intro web dev class about 4 years ago and learned a lot about CSS, the box model, specificity, the cascade. You know what’s tragic though? Not practicing it and instead reaching for a UI library that would make my projects pretty.

It’s unfortunate, not just for me, but for all devs and engineers that a lot of us lack the ability to see CSS as a valuable tool for developing web apps, not a UI library, but actual CSS. Learning it is valuable, even if you want to play logician with heavy handed JavaScript.

Project near done

This freelance project is nearly finished, well, at least my part of it. I learned that I still have a ton to learn about CSS. The project is on a hella tight deadline and it would be one thing if it wasn’t but it is and so I’m probably getting moved off it.

I don’t feel that bad about it though because I know where I need to improve. It was also really hectic moving as fast as we did. I feel bad for the senior front end engineer on that team because she’s got to put out fires that I couldn’t imagine putting out. Not now, anyway.

Experience

I’ve gained valuable insight into what my strengths and weaknesses are. If the project moves on without me I am taking a week to just relax and apply to jobs. While I’m at it, I am going to consume Wes Bos’ CSS courses because well. I’m bad it and it won’t ever go out of style.*5&#x2F;mo, #### [Dev Research, A Zettelkasten](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiffanywhite.dev&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;03&#x2F;dev-research-a-zettelkasten&#x2F;)

It’s nice enough, but I didn’t design or build this. I just edited a template and there it was. Finished portfolio. That’s it. Right?

Time to grow up

Losing my job was the best thing to happen to me as a dev for a variety of reasons. Having the job in the first place and flailing was also one of the best things to happen to me. I learned so much by struggling daily with the tasks I needed to do. Once laid off and stepping back a bit, I took the opportunity to learn and build stuff and get better as a developer. I did some hard things, some fun things, and took up some courses to learn algorithms and system design.

I’ve leveled up even more so than just a couple months ago. I have confidence. So I feel like it is beyond time to expand my skills and rebuild my entire portfolio from scratch.

Portfolio Inspo

I don’t know how I came upon Brittany Chiang’s portfolio but I am glad I did. I am struck by the animations, the design, the aesthetic. It is right up my alley. The problem is I am not skilled enough at design to pull this off.


    
    
      Brittany&#39;s portfolio is first class
       
          
            
            
        
       
    


So instead of just straight up forking this and editing it, I downloaded the zip to my machine and went through the code, looking at the package file to see what was installed. It’s a Gatsby site, which I am familiar with, so I looked at the config, the webpack config, and more. I even asked a question about a webpack config I didn’t understand in the repo and when answered, went looking deeper for documentation on the limitations of webpack server-side rendering.

I am not ripping this off. I will do my own design and make it nice, going just slightly above my comfort level.

Gatsby is my choice for portfolio self-expression

Gatbsy boilerplate is easy to get running and configurable. Then it is up to you to make it your own. I am using the gatsby-starter-default Starter and going from there.

Ali Spittel explained it best on the We Learn Code blog:


  Make a portfolio that is a true expression of yourself. Programming is in a lot of ways a creative field, so use your creativity!


[…]


  I would steer away from using a template found online – to me, it’s pretty apparent when these are used. I understand using them for people who aren’t web developers, but if you are a web developer show off your skills!


That’s good enough reason for me to grow up and get my hands dirty.

Well, this was a ride. But I came out on the other end. The following is a case study of my journey adding low highlights to headings and links to this blog.


To add a bit more color and style to this blog by adding a low highlight to headers and links, much like you can find on the Rust landing page and Wes Bos’ website.


    
    
       Rust&#39;s landing page highlights

Motivation

I wanted my blog to look cool and modern, fancy, like the big kids in this space. I also wanted to flex my CSS muscles, as that is one of my weaker areas1.

Process
At first, I went into DevTools and copied the CSS from Rust’s webpage. It didn’t quite work. None of my highlights were showing and I didn’t debug because I felt like something deeper was at play2. I decided to skip this idea and go a different route.

I did a bit of Google-fu on how to get this effect and came across  How to create a low highlight behind your text by Thirty Eight Visuals. It’s a tutorial on how to do this on Squarespace but you can apply it to any website.

I copied this snippet of code:

 background: linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0) 65%, #ffc1d2 65%);
  display: inline;


created a class and added that to the h1 element in my page.html file. The resulting code looks something like this:

h1.highlight {
  background: linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0) 65%, #ffc1d2 65%);
  display: inline;
}


This worked for all the h1 elements, but I also wanted the h2 and h3 elements to be highlighted. In this instance, it also only highlighted the h1 elements on the index page, which in my Jekyll theme is default.html.

I tried to add a class to all the header elements but it still didn’t work. I found it difficult to actually target those specific elements with the .highlight class. If I added the class to all the header elements in one template, it didn’t go across all the other templates in my _layouts folder.

Targeting inline header elements

I wanted all header elements to be highlighted on every page. It was difficult to accomplish this with the different templates that my Jekyll theme has in its _layouts folder.

I dug into the Sass in my theme and looked for any classes that targeted what I wanted and added the gradient to them but that also didn’t work.


    
    
       This image doesn&#39;t capture the half of it...
       
          
            
            
        
       
    


I decided to head back to Google, Stack Overflow and try to find something to help me with this.

MDN and the :not() selector

One of the things I wanted to do was exclude certain elements with certain classes. I found the  :not() selector on MDN.

At first it confused me; what are we excluding?

At first I selected all of the elements I wanted to change and added the :not() selector, for instance p:not(.some-class) which highlighted all the p elements that did not have that class. This meant all paragraphs in the body were selected.

I tried to add the linear gradient to all the main hn selectors which meant even those elements that I didn’t want selected, like the tags or header in the newsletter box had the gradient added to them which I didn’t want. I also wanted to add the gradient to different links in the body. I did the same for the anchor elements, not realizing that the social icons and tags were also links, thus having all the social icons, tags, and other buttons included in the linear gradient selection. It was a disaster so I went back to the docs and reread them.

Decided :not() was not the right selector3

I tried to use :first-child() selector but then I’d need to select different elements that were not descendants to the parent element because this Jekyll theme and Liquid templating is hard to reason about when it comes to custom styles.

Looked up the :nth-child() selector and decided that wouldn’t work either.

Sat on it for a few minutes, Googling and trawling Stack Overflow.

Back to basics

Went back to CSS fundamentals and realized I could just add a background: #fff to the elements that I didn’t want the highlight to be included in. Learned more about specificity and how to order selectors along the cascade to target specific elements, for example:

p.site-info a {
  background: #fff;
}

to target all the p elements with the class site.info that have an anchor tag, a as a descendant I also changed the color of the text selection when a user selects text on most of the site with the ::selection selector.

Oh …and a scrollbar

What good is a dev blog without a fancy scrollbar?

Got the idea from swyx and CSS-Tricks.

body::-webkit-scrollbar {
  width: 1em;
}

body::-webkit-scrollbar-track {
  -webkit-box-shadow: inset 0 0 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}

body::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
  background: rgb(6, 215, 217);
  background: linear-gradient(45deg, rgba(6, 215, 217, 1) 0%, rgba(255, 193, 210, 1.00) 35%, rgba(6, 215, 217, 1) 100%);
  border-radius: 3em;
}

Conclusion

CSS can be fun at times and sprucing up this blog with some fancy CSS tricks was quite an adventure.

Learning about specificity, different CSS selectors, and the like, made for a fun yet frustrating evening and I am glad I did it.

Edit:

I could have used a CSS variable instead of writing background: #fff everywhere, declaring the :root pseudo-class and declaring a variable like so:

:root {
  --non-highlights: #fff;
}


And then applying this variable everywhere I need, like this:

.non-highlights {
  var(--non-highlights)
}


I plan on implementing this soon.

*Learning the hard way that CSS, is in fact, a necessary skill.

Most of experience with CSS was through libraries like Bootstrap, Reactstrap, Bulma, and Tailwind.css.

In this recent project, I had to Flexbox and Flexbox quickly. I have a Wes Bos grid and flexbox course sitting in the course library I have of his. I never watched either, thinking I was mainly going to JavaScript the f out of things with little consideration to the styling.

I like beautiful things but CSS intimidates me, as it does a lot of JavaScript devs. You know the gif I’m talking about. I just recently shared this gif on a site complaining about how hard CSS is.

I have a metric heckton of respect for CSS mavens and masters. Because I suck at it. Give me the logic in a project and I’ll get it done. Tell me to skew a div and I am like what are a skew? What means degrees? I am terrible at complex layouts like this.

CS web dev classes

I took an intro web dev class about 4 years ago and learned a lot about CSS, the box model, specificity, the cascade. You know what’s tragic though? Not practicing it and instead reaching for a UI library that would make my projects pretty.

It’s unfortunate, not just for me, but for all devs and engineers that a lot of us lack the ability to see CSS as a valuable tool for developing web apps, not a UI library, but actual CSS. Learning it is valuable, even if you want to play logician with heavy handed JavaScript.

Project near done

This freelance project is nearly finished, well, at least my part of it. I learned that I still have a ton to learn about CSS. The project is on a hella tight deadline and it would be one thing if it wasn’t but it is and so I’m probably getting moved off it.

I don’t feel that bad about it though because I know where I need to improve. It was also really hectic moving as fast as we did. I feel bad for the senior front end engineer on that team because she’s got to put out fires that I couldn’t imagine putting out. Not now, anyway.

Experience

I’ve gained valuable insight into what my strengths and weaknesses are. If the project moves on without me I am taking a week to just relax and apply to jobs. While I’m at it, I am going to consume Wes Bos’ CSS courses because well. I’m bad it and it won’t ever go out of style.*65&#x2F;yr. Thinking about signing up for a year and see where that takes me. ↩*

I did some hard things, some fun things, and took up some courses to learn algorithms and system design.

I’ve leveled up even more so than just a couple months ago. I have confidence. So I feel like it is beyond time to expand my skills and rebuild my entire portfolio from scratch.

Portfolio Inspo

I don’t know how I came upon Brittany Chiang’s portfolio but I am glad I did. I am struck by the animations, the design, the aesthetic. It is right up my alley. The problem is I am not skilled enough at design to pull this off.

I even asked a question about a webpack config I didn’t understand in the repo and when answered, went looking deeper for documentation on the limitations of webpack server-side rendering.

This freelance project is nearly finished, well, at least my part of it. I learned that I still have a ton to learn about CSS. The project is on a hella tight deadline and it would be one thing if it wasn’t but it is and so I’m probably getting moved off it.

I don’t feel that bad about it though because I know where I need to improve. It was also really hectic moving as fast as we did. I feel bad for the senior front end engineer on that team because she’s got to put out fires that I couldn’t imagine putting out. Not now, anyway.

Experience

I’ve gained valuable insight into what my strengths and weaknesses are. If the project moves on without me I am taking a week to just relax and apply to jobs. While I’m at it, I am going to consume Wes Bos’ CSS courses because well. I’m bad it and it won’t ever go out of style.*5&#x2F;mo, #### [Dev Research, A Zettelkasten](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiffanywhite.dev&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;03&#x2F;dev-research-a-zettelkasten&#x2F;)

I’ve recently discovered the ZettelKasten Method for researching and taking notes.

I first heard about it when I signed up for Roam Research a note taking tool for networked thought who’s popularity1 is skyrocketing.

I got in right before the servers crashed and they had to make Roam and invite only beta. It was free then2 and I just didn’t get it. People talked about the Zettelkasten Method or Second Brain method by Tiago Forte, but I’d never heard of either of them, and when I research both, the one that stuck with me was the Zettelkasten Method.

There have been offshoots of Roam, some free, some paid, and it’s not hard to understand why. The buzz around Roam is real.

I’ve looked at several different free alternatives to Roam even though I am a paying customer and in either a Reddit or newsletter post I found Foam.

According to the docs:


  [Foam is]…a personal knowledge management and sharing system for VSCode


It’s dead simple to setup, comes with its own extensions, and as you can see here, looks and feels like Roam, only in VSCode.

My current portfolio is written in Jekyll with a premade theme I found on GitHub. I have had many different versions over the years1, most of which I have found some boilerplate online and customized it2.

Below are some screenshots of my current portfolio.

It’s nice enough, but I didn’t design or build this. I just edited a template and there it was. Finished portfolio. That’s it. Right?

Time to grow up

Losing my job was the best thing to happen to me as a dev for a variety of reasons. Having the job in the first place and flailing was also one of the best things to happen to me. I learned so much by struggling daily with the tasks I needed to do. Once laid off and stepping back a bit, I took the opportunity to learn and build stuff and get better as a developer. I did some hard things, some fun things, and took up some courses to learn algorithms and system design.

I’ve leveled up even more so than just a couple months ago. I have confidence. So I feel like it is beyond time to expand my skills and rebuild my entire portfolio from scratch.

Portfolio Inspo

I don’t know how I came upon Brittany Chiang’s portfolio but I am glad I did. I am struck by the animations, the design, the aesthetic. It is right up my alley. The problem is I am not skilled enough at design to pull this off.


    
    
      Brittany&#39;s portfolio is first class
       
          
            
            
        
       
    


So instead of just straight up forking this and editing it, I downloaded the zip to my machine and went through the code, looking at the package file to see what was installed. It’s a Gatsby site, which I am familiar with, so I looked at the config, the webpack config, and more. I even asked a question about a webpack config I didn’t understand in the repo and when answered, went looking deeper for documentation on the limitations of webpack server-side rendering.

I am not ripping this off. I will do my own design and make it nice, going just slightly above my comfort level.

Gatsby is my choice for portfolio self-expression

Gatbsy boilerplate is easy to get running and configurable. Then it is up to you to make it your own. I am using the gatsby-starter-default Starter and going from there.

Ali Spittel explained it best on the We Learn Code blog:


  Make a portfolio that is a true expression of yourself. Programming is in a lot of ways a creative field, so use your creativity!


[…]


  I would steer away from using a template found online – to me, it’s pretty apparent when these are used. I understand using them for people who aren’t web developers, but if you are a web developer show off your skills!


That’s good enough reason for me to grow up and get my hands dirty.

*A case study on a trial by fire primer on CSS.

Well, this was a ride. But I came out on the other end. The following is a case study of my journey adding low highlights to headings and links to this blog.


To add a bit more color and style to this blog by adding a low highlight to headers and links, much like you can find on the Rust landing page and Wes Bos’ website.


    
    
       Rust&#39;s landing page highlights
       
          
            
            
        
       
    



    
    
       Wes&#39; sense of design is always top notch. Always a bit of whimsy with his stuff.
       
          
            
            
        
       
    



    
    
       Wes kinda trolling me lol.
       
          
            
            
        
       
    


Motivation

I wanted my blog to look cool and modern, fancy, like the big kids in this space. I also wanted to flex my CSS muscles, as that is one of my weaker areas1.

Process
At first, I went into DevTools and copied the CSS from Rust’s webpage. It didn’t quite work. None of my highlights were showing and I didn’t debug because I felt like something deeper was at play2. I decided to skip this idea and go a different route.

I did a bit of Google-fu on how to get this effect and came across  How to create a low highlight behind your text by Thirty Eight Visuals. It’s a tutorial on how to do this on Squarespace but you can apply it to any website.

I copied this snippet of code:

 background: linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0) 65%, #ffc1d2 65%);
  display: inline;


created a class and added that to the h1 element in my page.html file. The resulting code looks something like this:

h1.highlight {
  background: linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0) 65%, #ffc1d2 65%);
  display: inline;
}


This worked for all the h1 elements, but I also wanted the h2 and h3 elements to be highlighted. In this instance, it also only highlighted the h1 elements on the index page, which in my Jekyll theme is default.html.

I tried to add a class to all the header elements but it still didn’t work. I found it difficult to actually target those specific elements with the .highlight class. If I added the class to all the header elements in one template, it didn’t go across all the other templates in my _layouts folder.

Targeting inline header elements

I wanted all header elements to be highlighted on every page. It was difficult to accomplish this with the different templates that my Jekyll theme has in its _layouts folder.

I dug into the Sass in my theme and looked for any classes that targeted what I wanted and added the gradient to them but that also didn’t work.


    
    
       This image doesn&#39;t capture the half of it...
       
          
            
            
        
       
    


I decided to head back to Google, Stack Overflow and try to find something to help me with this.

MDN and the :not() selector

One of the things I wanted to do was exclude certain elements with certain classes. I found the  :not() selector on MDN.

At first it confused me; what are we excluding?

At first I selected all of the elements I wanted to change and added the :not() selector, for instance p:not(.some-class) which highlighted all the p elements that did not have that class. This meant all paragraphs in the body were selected.

I tried to add the linear gradient to all the main hn selectors which meant even those elements that I didn’t want selected, like the tags or header in the newsletter box had the gradient added to them which I didn’t want. I also wanted to add the gradient to different links in the body. I did the same for the anchor elements, not realizing that the social icons and tags were also links, thus having all the social icons, tags, and other buttons included in the linear gradient selection. It was a disaster so I went back to the docs and reread them.

Decided :not() was not the right selector3

I tried to use :first-child() selector but then I’d need to select different elements that were not descendants to the parent element because this Jekyll theme and Liquid templating is hard to reason about when it comes to custom styles.

Looked up the :nth-child() selector and decided that wouldn’t work either.

Sat on it for a few minutes, Googling and trawling Stack Overflow.

Back to basics

Went back to CSS fundamentals and realized I could just add a background: #fff to the elements that I didn’t want the highlight to be included in. Learned more about specificity and how to order selectors along the cascade to target specific elements, for example:

p.site-info a {
  background: #fff;
}

to target all the p elements with the class site.info that have an anchor tag, a as a descendant I also changed the color of the text selection when a user selects text on most of the site with the ::selection selector.

Oh …and a scrollbar

What good is a dev blog without a fancy scrollbar?

Got the idea from swyx and CSS-Tricks.

body::-webkit-scrollbar {
  width: 1em;
}

body::-webkit-scrollbar-track {
  -webkit-box-shadow: inset 0 0 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}

body::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
  background: rgb(6, 215, 217);
  background: linear-gradient(45deg, rgba(6, 215, 217, 1) 0%, rgba(255, 193, 210, 1.00) 35%, rgba(6, 215, 217, 1) 100%);
  border-radius: 3em;
}


scrollbar CSS-Tricks


  See the Pen 
  Scrollbar Idea (CSS-Tricks) by Tiffany White (@tiffanywhitedev)
  on CodePen.




Conclusion

CSS can be fun at times and sprucing up this blog with some fancy CSS tricks was quite an adventure.

Learning about specificity, different CSS selectors, and the like, made for a fun yet frustrating evening and I am glad I did it.

Edit:

I could have used a CSS variable instead of writing background: #fff everywhere, declaring the :root pseudo-class and declaring a variable like so:

:root {
  --non-highlights: #fff;
}


And then applying this variable everywhere I need, like this:

.non-highlights {
  var(--non-highlights)
}


I plan on implementing this soon.

I am going to be doing some blogging about my projects and what I am learning along the way. I said back in 2018 that I was switching things up, but as someone searching for a job, I feel like all types of content should go here.


I have been brushing up on my CSS lately1 and what I’ve discovered is that CodePen is the perfect place to prototype different concepts.

It’s quick and dirty, no real complicated setup needed. Just jump in, create a div with some class and start firing some CSS in the CSS section. It live updates so you can see your changes almost immediately.

*Learning the hard way that CSS, is in fact, a necessary skill.

Most of experience with CSS was through libraries like Bootstrap, Reactstrap, Bulma, and Tailwind.css.

In this recent project, I had to Flexbox and Flexbox quickly. I have a Wes Bos grid and flexbox course sitting in the course library I have of his. I never watched either, thinking I was mainly going to JavaScript the f out of things with little consideration to the styling.

I like beautiful things but CSS intimidates me, as it does a lot of JavaScript devs. You know the gif I’m talking about. I just recently shared this gif on a site complaining about how hard CSS is.

I have a metric heckton of respect for CSS mavens and masters. Because I suck at it. Give me the logic in a project and I’ll get it done. Tell me to skew a div and I am like what are a skew? What means degrees? I am terrible at complex layouts like this.

CS web dev classes

I took an intro web dev class about 4 years ago and learned a lot about CSS, the box model, specificity, the cascade. You know what’s tragic though? Not practicing it and instead reaching for a UI library that would make my projects pretty.

It’s unfortunate, not just for me, but for all devs and engineers that a lot of us lack the ability to see CSS as a valuable tool for developing web apps, not a UI library, but actual CSS. Learning it is valuable, even if you want to play logician with heavy handed JavaScript.

Well, this was a ride. But I came out on the other end. The following is a case study of my journey adding low highlights to headings and links to this blog.


To add a bit more color and style to this blog by adding a low highlight to headers and links, much like you can find on the Rust landing page and Wes Bos’ website.


    
    
       Rust&#39;s landing page highlights
       
          
            
            
        
       
    



    
    
       Wes&#39; sense of design is always top notch. Always a bit of whimsy with his stuff.

Motivation

I wanted my blog to look cool and modern, fancy, like the big kids in this space. I also wanted to flex my CSS muscles, as that is one of my weaker areas1.

Process
At first, I went into DevTools and copied the CSS from Rust’s webpage. It didn’t quite work. None of my highlights were showing and I didn’t debug because I felt like something deeper was at play2. I decided to skip this idea and go a different route.

I did a bit of Google-fu on how to get this effect and came across  How to create a low highlight behind your text by Thirty Eight Visuals. It’s a tutorial on how to do this on Squarespace but you can apply it to any website.

I copied this snippet of code:

 background: linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0) 65%, #ffc1d2 65%);
  display: inline;


created a class and added that to the h1 element in my page.html file. The resulting code looks something like this:

h1.highlight {
  background: linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0) 65%, #ffc1d2 65%);
  display: inline;
}


This worked for all the h1 elements, but I also wanted the h2 and h3 elements to be highlighted. In this instance, it also only highlighted the h1 elements on the index page, which in my Jekyll theme is default.html.

I tried to add a class to all the header elements but it still didn’t work. I found it difficult to actually target those specific elements with the .highlight class. If I added the class to all the header elements in one template, it didn’t go across all the other templates in my _layouts folder.

Targeting inline header elements

I wanted all header elements to be highlighted on every page. It was difficult to accomplish this with the different templates that my Jekyll theme has in its _layouts folder.

I dug into the Sass in my theme and looked for any classes that targeted what I wanted and added the gradient to them but that also didn’t work.


    
    
       This image doesn&#39;t capture the half of it...
       
          
            
            
        
       
    


I decided to head back to Google, Stack Overflow and try to find something to help me with this.

MDN and the :not() selector

One of the things I wanted to do was exclude certain elements with certain classes. I found the  :not() selector on MDN.

At first it confused me; what are we excluding?

At first I selected all of the elements I wanted to change and added the :not() selector, for instance p:not(.some-class) which highlighted all the p elements that did not have that class. This meant all paragraphs in the body were selected.

I tried to add the linear gradient to all the main hn selectors which meant even those elements that I didn’t want selected, like the tags or header in the newsletter box had the gradient added to them which I didn’t want. I also wanted to add the gradient to different links in the body. I did the same for the anchor elements, not realizing that the social icons and tags were also links, thus having all the social icons, tags, and other buttons included in the linear gradient selection. It was a disaster so I went back to the docs and reread them.

Decided :not() was not the right selector3

I tried to use :first-child() selector but then I’d need to select different elements that were not descendants to the parent element because this Jekyll theme and Liquid templating is hard to reason about when it comes to custom styles.

Looked up the :nth-child() selector and decided that wouldn’t work either.

Sat on it for a few minutes, Googling and trawling Stack Overflow.

Back to basics

Went back to CSS fundamentals and realized I could just add a background: #fff to the elements that I didn’t want the highlight to be included in. Learned more about specificity and how to order selectors along the cascade to target specific elements, for example:

p.site-info a {
  background: #fff;
}

to target all the p elements with the class site.info that have an anchor tag, a as a descendant I also changed the color of the text selection when a user selects text on most of the site with the ::selection selector.

Oh …and a scrollbar

What good is a dev blog without a fancy scrollbar?

Got the idea from swyx and CSS-Tricks.

body::-webkit-scrollbar {
  width: 1em;
}

body::-webkit-scrollbar-track {
  -webkit-box-shadow: inset 0 0 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}

body::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
  background: rgb(6, 215, 217);
  background: linear-gradient(45deg, rgba(6, 215, 217, 1) 0%, rgba(255, 193, 210, 1.00) 35%, rgba(6, 215, 217, 1) 100%);
  border-radius: 3em;
}

Conclusion

CSS can be fun at times and sprucing up this blog with some fancy CSS tricks was quite an adventure.

Learning about specificity, different CSS selectors, and the like, made for a fun yet frustrating evening and I am glad I did it.

Edit:

I could have used a CSS variable instead of writing background: #fff everywhere, declaring the :root pseudo-class and declaring a variable like so:

:root {
  --non-highlights: #fff;
}


And then applying this variable everywhere I need, like this:

.non-highlights {
  var(--non-highlights)
}


I plan on implementing this soon.

*Learning the hard way that CSS, is in fact, a necessary skill.

Most of experience with CSS was through libraries like Bootstrap, Reactstrap, Bulma, and Tailwind.css.

In this recent project, I had to Flexbox and Flexbox quickly. I have a Wes Bos grid and flexbox course sitting in the course library I have of his. I never watched either, thinking I was mainly going to JavaScript the f out of things with little consideration to the styling.

I like beautiful things but CSS intimidates me, as it does a lot of JavaScript devs. You know the gif I’m talking about. I just recently shared this gif on a site complaining about how hard CSS is.

I have a metric heckton of respect for CSS mavens and masters. Because I suck at it. Give me the logic in a project and I’ll get it done. Tell me to skew a div and I am like what are a skew? What means degrees? I am terrible at complex layouts like this.

CS web dev classes

I took an intro web dev class about 4 years ago and learned a lot about CSS, the box model, specificity, the cascade. You know what’s tragic though? Not practicing it and instead reaching for a UI library that would make my projects pretty.

It’s unfortunate, not just for me, but for all devs and engineers that a lot of us lack the ability to see CSS as a valuable tool for developing web apps, not a UI library, but actual CSS. Learning it is valuable, even if you want to play logician with heavy handed JavaScript.

Project near done

This freelance project is nearly finished, well, at least my part of it. I learned that I still have a ton to learn about CSS. The project is on a hella tight deadline and it would be one thing if it wasn’t but it is and so I’m probably getting moved off it.

I’ve gained valuable insight into what my strengths and weaknesses are. If the project moves on without me I am taking a week to just relax and apply to jobs.

My current portfolio is written in Jekyll with a premade theme I found on GitHub. I have had many different versions over the years1, most of which I have found some boilerplate online and customized it2.

Below are some screenshots of my current portfolio.

It’s nice enough, but I didn’t design or build this. I just edited a template and there it was. Finished portfolio. That’s it. Right?

Time to grow up

Losing my job was the best thing to happen to me as a dev for a variety of reasons. Having the job in the first place and flailing was also one of the best things to happen to me. I learned so much by struggling daily with the tasks I needed to do. Once laid off and stepping back a bit, I took the opportunity to learn and build stuff and get better as a developer. I did some hard things, some fun things, and took up some courses to learn algorithms and system design.

I’ve leveled up even more so than just a couple months ago. I have confidence. So I feel like it is beyond time to expand my skills and rebuild my entire portfolio from scratch.

Portfolio Inspo

I don’t know how I came upon Brittany Chiang’s portfolio but I am glad I did. I am struck by the animations, the design, the aesthetic. It is right up my alley. The problem is I am not skilled enough at design to pull this off.


    
    
      Brittany&#39;s portfolio is first class
       
          
            
            
        
       
    


So instead of just straight up forking this and editing it, I downloaded the zip to my machine and went through the code, looking at the package file to see what was installed. It’s a Gatsby site, which I am familiar with, so I looked at the config, the webpack config, and more. I even asked a question about a webpack config I didn’t understand in the repo and when answered, went looking deeper for documentation on the limitations of webpack server-side rendering.

I am not ripping this off. I will do my own design and make it nice, going just slightly above my comfort level.

Gatsby is my choice for portfolio self-expression

Gatbsy boilerplate is easy to get running and configurable. Then it is up to you to make it your own. I am using the gatsby-starter-default Starter and going from there.

Ali Spittel explained it best on the We Learn Code blog:


  Make a portfolio that is a true expression of yourself. Programming is in a lot of ways a creative field, so use your creativity!


[…]


  I would steer away from using a template found online – to me, it’s pretty apparent when these are used. I understand using them for people who aren’t web developers, but if you are a web developer show off your skills!


That’s good enough reason for me to grow up and get my hands dirty.

I’ve leveled up even more so than just a couple months ago. I have confidence. So I feel like it is beyond time to expand my skills and rebuild my entire portfolio from scratch.

Portfolio Inspo

I don’t know how I came upon Brittany Chiang’s portfolio but I am glad I did. I am struck by the animations, the design, the aesthetic. It is right up my alley. The problem is I am not skilled enough at design to pull this off.


    
    
      Brittany&#39;s portfolio is first class
       
          
            
            
        
       
    


So instead of just straight up forking this and editing it, I downloaded the zip to my machine and went through the code, looking at the package file to see what was installed. It’s a Gatsby site, which I am familiar with, so I looked at the config, the webpack config, and more. I even asked a question about a webpack config I didn’t understand in the repo and when answered, went looking deeper for documentation on the limitations of webpack server-side rendering.

I am not ripping this off. I will do my own design and make it nice, going just slightly above my comfort level.

Gatsby is my choice for portfolio self-expression

Gatbsy boilerplate is easy to get running and configurable. Then it is up to you to make it your own. I am using the gatsby-starter-default Starter and going from there.

Ali Spittel explained it best on the We Learn Code blog:


  Make a portfolio that is a true expression of yourself. Programming is in a lot of ways a creative field, so use your creativity!


[…]


  I would steer away from using a template found online – to me, it’s pretty apparent when these are used. I understand using them for people who aren’t web developers, but if you are a web developer show off your skills!


That’s good enough reason for me to grow up and get my hands dirty.

Well, this was a ride. But I came out on the other end. The following is a case study of my journey adding low highlights to headings and links to this blog.


To add a bit more color and style to this blog by adding a low highlight to headers and links, much like you can find on the Rust landing page and Wes Bos’ website.


    
    
       Rust&#39;s landing page highlights
       
          
            
            
        
       
    



    
    
       Wes&#39; sense of design is always top notch. Always a bit of whimsy with his stuff.
       
          
            
            
        
       
    



    
    
       Wes kinda trolling me lol.
       
          
            
            
        
       
    


Motivation

I wanted my blog to look cool and modern, fancy, like the big kids in this space. I also wanted to flex my CSS muscles, as that is one of my weaker areas1.

Process
At first, I went into DevTools and copied the CSS from Rust’s webpage. It didn’t quite work. None of my highlights were showing and I didn’t debug because I felt like something deeper was at play2. I decided to skip this idea and go a different route.

I did a bit of Google-fu on how to get this effect and came across  How to create a low highlight behind your text by Thirty Eight Visuals. It’s a tutorial on how to do this on Squarespace but you can apply it to any website.

I copied this snippet of code:

 background: linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0) 65%, #ffc1d2 65%);
  display: inline;


created a class and added that to the h1 element in my page.html file. The resulting code looks something like this:

h1.highlight {
  background: linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0) 65%, #ffc1d2 65%);
  display: inline;
}


This worked for all the h1 elements, but I also wanted the h2 and h3 elements to be highlighted. In this instance, it also only highlighted the h1 elements on the index page, which in my Jekyll theme is default.html.

I tried to add a class to all the header elements but it still didn’t work. I found it difficult to actually target those specific elements with the .highlight class. If I added the class to all the header elements in one template, it didn’t go across all the other templates in my _layouts folder.

Targeting inline header elements

I wanted all header elements to be highlighted on every page. It was difficult to accomplish this with the different templates that my Jekyll theme has in its _layouts folder.

I dug into the Sass in my theme and looked for any classes that targeted what I wanted and added the gradient to them but that also didn’t work.


    
    
       This image doesn&#39;t capture the half of it...
       
          
            
            
        
       
    


I decided to head back to Google, Stack Overflow and try to find something to help me with this.

MDN and the :not() selector

One of the things I wanted to do was exclude certain elements with certain classes. I found the  :not() selector on MDN.

At first it confused me; what are we excluding?

At first I selected all of the elements I wanted to change and added the :not() selector, for instance p:not(.some-class) which highlighted all the p elements that did not have that class. This meant all paragraphs in the body were selected.

I tried to add the linear gradient to all the main hn selectors which meant even those elements that I didn’t want selected, like the tags or header in the newsletter box had the gradient added to them which I didn’t want. I also wanted to add the gradient to different links in the body. I did the same for the anchor elements, not realizing that the social icons and tags were also links, thus having all the social icons, tags, and other buttons included in the linear gradient selection. It was a disaster so I went back to the docs and reread them.

Decided :not() was not the right selector3

I tried to use :first-child() selector but then I’d need to select different elements that were not descendants to the parent element because this Jekyll theme and Liquid templating is hard to reason about when it comes to custom styles.

Looked up the :nth-child() selector and decided that wouldn’t work either.

Sat on it for a few minutes, Googling and trawling Stack Overflow.

Back to basics

Went back to CSS fundamentals and realized I could just add a background: #fff to the elements that I didn’t want the highlight to be included in. Learned more about specificity and how to order selectors along the cascade to target specific elements, for example:

p.site-info a {
  background: #fff;
}

to target all the p elements with the class site.info that have an anchor tag, a as a descendant I also changed the color of the text selection when a user selects text on most of the site with the ::selection selector.

Oh …and a scrollbar

What good is a dev blog without a fancy scrollbar?

Got the idea from swyx and CSS-Tricks.

body::-webkit-scrollbar {
  width: 1em;
}

body::-webkit-scrollbar-track {
  -webkit-box-shadow: inset 0 0 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}

body::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
  background: rgb(6, 215, 217);
  background: linear-gradient(45deg, rgba(6, 215, 217, 1) 0%, rgba(255, 193, 210, 1.00) 35%, rgba(6, 215, 217, 1) 100%);
  border-radius: 3em;
}

Conclusion

CSS can be fun at times and sprucing up this blog with some fancy CSS tricks was quite an adventure.

Learning about specificity, different CSS selectors, and the like, made for a fun yet frustrating evening and I am glad I did it.

Edit:

I could have used a CSS variable instead of writing background: #fff everywhere, declaring the :root pseudo-class and declaring a variable like so:

:root {
  --non-highlights: #fff;
}


And then applying this variable everywhere I need, like this:

.non-highlights {
  var(--non-highlights)
}


I plan on implementing this soon.

I am going to be doing some blogging about my projects and what I am learning along the way. I said back in 2018 that I was switching things up, but as someone searching for a job, I feel like all types of content should go here.


I have been brushing up on my CSS lately1 and what I’ve discovered is that CodePen is the perfect place to prototype different concepts.

It’s quick and dirty, no real complicated setup needed. Just jump in, create a div with some class and start firing some CSS in the CSS section. It live updates so you can see your changes almost immediately.

*Learning the hard way that CSS, is in fact, a necessary skill.

Most of experience with CSS was through libraries like Bootstrap, Reactstrap, Bulma, and Tailwind.css.

In this recent project, I had to Flexbox and Flexbox quickly. I have a Wes Bos grid and flexbox course sitting in the course library I have of his. I never watched either, thinking I was mainly going to JavaScript the f out of things with little consideration to the styling.

I like beautiful things but CSS intimidates me, as it does a lot of JavaScript devs. You know the gif I’m talking about. I just recently shared this gif on a site complaining about how hard CSS is.

I have a metric heckton of respect for CSS mavens and masters. Because I suck at it. Give me the logic in a project and I’ll get it done. Tell me to skew a div and I am like what are a skew? What means degrees? I am terrible at complex layouts like this.

CS web dev classes

I took an intro web dev class about 4 years ago and learned a lot about CSS, the box model, specificity, the cascade. You know what’s tragic though? Not practicing it and instead reaching for a UI library that would make my projects pretty.

It’s unfortunate, not just for me, but for all devs and engineers that a lot of us lack the ability to see CSS as a valuable tool for developing web apps, not a UI library, but actual CSS. Learning it is valuable, even if you want to play logician with heavy handed JavaScript.

Project near done

This freelance project is nearly finished, well, at least my part of it. I learned that I still have a ton to learn about CSS. The project is on a hella tight deadline and it would be one thing if it wasn’t but it is and so I’m probably getting moved off it.

I don’t feel that bad about it though because I know where I need to improve. It was also really hectic moving as fast as we did. I feel bad for the senior front end engineer on that team because she’s got to put out fires that I couldn’t imagine putting out. Not now, anyway.

Experience

I’ve gained valuable insight into what my strengths and weaknesses are. If the project moves on without me I am taking a week to just relax and apply to jobs. While I’m at it, I am going to consume Wes Bos’ CSS courses because well. I’m bad it and it won’t ever go out of style.*
