## You settled? Good. Some rando facts about me.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my book finder app that uses Google Books API and [Check Yo Self](https://check-yoself.app/), an app to check your markdown for spelling and grammar errors, currently an MVP.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GraphQL, Go, Typescript, and brushing up pn React core concepts
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with getting up and running with more complex React/frontend engineering ideas and paradigms.
- 📫 How to reach me: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tiffanywhitedev) or <a href="mailto:tiffany@tiffanyrwhite.com">email</a> is the best way to reach me.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: [Cats are everything good and pure in this world](https://twhite96.github.io/v2/offline.html), even if I am allergic to them. (Can have one or two shorthairs. Anymore than that I'll asphyxiate 🙁)

## And, of course, #ForTheA ⚾️
